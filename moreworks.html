            <h2 style="color:#0078ff">Calculator - Personal</h2>
            <p>The Calculator App is a Java-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
              Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers by clicking the appropriate buttons on the GUI. 
              The app also includes a decimal point button, a clear button to clear the input field, and an equals button to calculate the result.
            </p>
            <p>The app is designed with a user-friendly interface and is built using Java programming principles to ensure efficient and secure arithmetic calculations. 
              The GUI was created using Java's Swing toolkit, allowing for the application to be run on multiple platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the Calculator App is a simple yet powerful tool that provides users with a convenient way to perform basic operations with ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              A new version of the Calculator app was built using Python and Tkinter. 
              This time, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed with Tkinter.

          <p>This project showcases an automatic dog feeder that dispenses food and water at specified times throughout the day, 
            eliminating the need for pet owners to manually feed their dogs. </p>
          <p>The system is built using an Arduino board, breadboards, sensors, and water pumps, 
            programmed with C++ to accurately dispense the right amount of food and water at the right time. The system will stop dispensing after each bowl reaches its capacity
            using a weight sensor.</p>
          <p>
            The project demonstrates a practical application of embedded systems, programming, and electronics to improve the lives of pets and their owners.

          <p>The Digital Alarm Clock project is a digital clock that was developed using an STM32 board. 
            The project was implemented using Vivado, a hardware description language (HDL) design suite that allowed for the creation and simulation of the circuits before final design implementation. 
            The clock's functionality includes setting the current time and setting alarms that can be customized to sound at specific times of the day. 
            Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), was used to write the code for the clock's operations. 
            The project demonstrates proficiency in embedded systems development and hardware design. </p>

          <p>This project involved the transformation of an old PC into a powerful home server. 
            With Linux as the operating system, this server now houses important files and serves various functions.</p>
            <p>
              The project required configuring network settings and ensuring the server was optimized for its intended use. 
              Additionally, various software packages were installed to enhance the server's performance, security, and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final result was a reliable, efficient, and secure home server used for storage and media consumption.

          <p>I designed and implemented a 64-bit adder and subtractor for a 16-bit CPU using Logisim. 
            The project involved creating and simulating the logic circuits for the adder and subtractor, as well as integrating them into the CPU architecture. </p>
            <p>
              I used Logisim's built-in components to design the circuits and tested them extensively to ensure correct operation. 
              Additionally, I optimized the circuits for speed and efficiency by using techniques such as parallelism and carry lookahead.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project helped me develop my skills in digital logic design and gave me a better understanding of how CPUs operate at a low level.

          <p>The Robotic Arm White Board Eraser is an innovative project that makes use of a STM32 board and is programmed in both C and Assembly. 
            This project is designed to automate the process of erasing a whiteboard using a robotic arm that is controlled by the STM32 board. 
            The user can input the coordinates of the area to be erased, and the arm will automatically move to that location and begin erasing.</p>
            <p>
              The project involves the use of multiple sensors and motors to control the movement and actions of the arm. 
              The STM32 board was programmed in both C and Assembly to efficiently manage the sensors and motors and to provide accurate control over the arm's movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, this project is a great example of how technology can be used to automate tasks and improve efficiency. 
              It also showcases the power and versatility of the STM32 board and the benefits of programming in C and Assembly.
